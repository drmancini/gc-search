## Random comments
- Stripe 82 has been repeatedly scanned by SDSS, and this is the region of highest quality <https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/2007MNRAS.379.1599L>. Unfortuunately haven't found any GC systems there.


## Search for confirmed GCs
Thousands of extragalactic GCs are catalogued by the Virgo Cluster Survey but the GCs are too far (15Mpc) to be resolved with confidence in SDSS and UKIDSS. We have to go closer.

Found a catalog of GC systems (A catalog of globular cluster systems by Harris et al., 2013). They have collected data from over 110 different GC studies and catalogues. It contains 422 individual systems with GCs and running various filters in gc_systems.py gets 7 candidate galaxies with hundreds of GCs. 

Tried to find more recent (after 2013) extragalactic catalogues of GCs within ~12 Mpc and found only one study: SLUGGS globular clusters in early-type galaxies (Pota+, 2013). It contains data from 27 galaxies of which Vizier only has data for 10. From these only one lies in UKIDSS/SDSS footprint: NGC3377, and that one is already included in Harris et al.


## Candidate systems
### NGC 3377 
elliptical galaxy
11 Mpc away, L1, 1.8 kpc
216 GCs in <https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/MNRAS/428/389/ngc3377>

### NGC 3379 (M105)
elliptical galaxy
10.2 Mpc away, L1, 1.8 kpc

### NGC 3384
SB0 galaxy
10.8 Mpc away, L1, 1.4 kpc

### NGC 3489
lenticular galaxy
12.1 Mpc away, L1, 1.2 kpc

### NGC 4517
spiral galaxy
9.3 Mpc away, L1, 4.2 kpc
Although 270 GC candidates had been identified, authors have published a catalog of only 50 of the brightest clusters. This is the faintest one <https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr18/VisualTools/quickobj?objId=1237651753476948716> and has decent S/N. I might look for the whole database.

### UGC-7369
dwarf spheroidal galaxy
11.6 Mpc away, L4, 0.8 kpc

### UGC-8638
irregular galaxy
has only 3 GCs so interesting only if adding the galaxy type helps in some way (need to test)
4.3 Mpc away, L4, 0.56 kpc
