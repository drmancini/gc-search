# Search for confirmed GCs
Thousands of extragalactic GCs are catalogued by the Virgo Cluster Survey but the GCs are too far (15Mpc) to be resolved with confidence in SDSS and UKIDSS. We have to go closer.

Found a catalog of GC systems (Harris et al., 2013). They have collected data from over 110 different GC studies and catalogues. It contains 422 individual systems with GCs and running various filters in gc_systems.py gets 7 candidate galaxies with hundreds of GCs.

Tried to find more recent extragalactic catalogues of GCs post 2013 within ~12 Mpc and found only one study (Pota+, 2013). It contains data from 27 galaxies on SLUGGS website. Of these only two are in UKIDSS/SDSS footprint: NGC 3377 which is already in (Harris et al., 2013) and NGC 2974.

## Candidate systems

### NGC 2974 (done)
27.3 Mpc away so way too far
26 GCs
Relevant studies: (Pota+, 2013)
GC data: <https://sluggs.swin.edu.au/Data.html>

### NGC 3377 (done)
elliptical galaxy
11 Mpc away, L1, 1.8 kpc
216 GCs
Relevant studies: (Pota+, 2013), (Cho+, 2012)
GC data: <https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/MNRAS/428/389/ngc3377>

### NGC 3379 (M105) (done)
elliptical galaxy
10.2 Mpc away, L1, 1.8 kpc
144 GCs
Relevant studies: (Faifer, F. R., 2011), (Rhode, K. L., & Zepf, S. E., 2003)
GC data: <https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/MNRAS/416/155/tablea1>

### NGC 3384 (pending)
SB0 galaxy
10.8 Mpc away, L1, 1.4 kpc
Hargis, J.R., & Rhode, K.L. 2012, AJ, 144, 164

### NGC 3489 (pending)
lenticular galaxy
12.1 Mpc away, L1, 1.2 kpc
should be 51 GCs but Haven't found data yet!!!
Relevant studies: (Kundu, A., & Whitmore, B. C, 2001)

### NGC 4517 (pending)
spiral galaxy
9.3 Mpc away, L1, 4.2 kpc
50 GCs (from 270)
Relevant studies: (Goudfrooij+, 2003)
GC Data: Although 270 GC candidates had been identified, authors have published a catalog of only 50 of the brightest clusters. This is the faintest one <https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr18/VisualTools/quickobj?objId=1237651753476948716> and has decent S/N. Wonder if entire database is available.

### UGC-7369 (done)
dwarf spheroidal galaxy
11.6 Mpc away, L4, 0.8 kpc
23 GCs
Relevant studies: (Georgiev, I. et al., 2010)
GC Data: <https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/MNRAS/392/879&-to=3>

### UGC-8638 (done)
irregular galaxy
has only 3 GCs so interesting only if adding the galaxy type helps in some way (need to test)
4.3 Mpc away, L4, 0.56 kpc
3 GCs
Relevant studies: (Georgiev, I. et al., 2010)
GC Data: <https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/MNRAS/392/879&-to=3>

## Random comments
- Stripe 82 has been repeatedly scanned by SDSS, and this is the region of highest quality <https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/2007MNRAS.379.1599L>. Unfortuunately haven't found any GC systems there.
